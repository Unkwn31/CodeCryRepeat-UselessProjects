### Project Description
The project is a simple map that gives you the distance between two locations of the users choice. The twist is that the units of measurement is not the conventional kilometers or meters but random items. The implementation can be seen below.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The problem is the use of conventional units for measurements is getting old and we thought of finding new measurements.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So we created a map to give the distance of two places in units other than kilometer.
